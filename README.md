# cs529-project2
Logistic Regression and Friends


## Setup
Since the training data is over a GB in size, it needs to be manually placed into this project. All that is missing is data\raw\train which can be retrieved from Google Drive.

Next step requires a conda installation on your system. First setup the environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cs529_proj2
```
Then run the source code to generate a model...
```bash
python src/
```



## File Manifest
